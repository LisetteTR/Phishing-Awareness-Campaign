<h1>Description Scenario</h1>
We conduct a phishing campaign to identify the most vulnerable departments. Once the results are in, we create a presentation for the departments that had the highest failure rates. We must create a Phishing email as believable as possible, like the example below.<br />

Data is collected on who clicked the link, entered credentials, or reported the email. After reviewing the results, we need to create a short presentation providing awareness training materials for the two teams that appear to be the most susceptible. This will help improve the security awareness of the teams that performed poorly in this campaign. 

<h1>PowerPoint Security Awareness Training</h1>
Below is an example of a PowerPoint presentation providing information to those who failed the phishing campaign test.
