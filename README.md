<h1>Description Scenario</h1>
We conduct a phishing campaign to identify the most vulnerable departments. Once the results are in, we create a presentation for the departments that had the highest failure rates. We must create a Phishing email as believable as possible, like the example below.<br />

<p>
Data is collected on who clicked the link, entered credentials, or reported the email. After reviewing the results, We need to create a short presentation providing some awareness training materials for the two teams that appear to be the most susceptible. This will help with improving the security awareness of the teams that preformed poorly in this campaign.
